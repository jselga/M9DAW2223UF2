        <p>
            It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory
            against the evil Galactic Empire.
        </p>
        <p> During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's             ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an
            armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
            Princess Leia races home aboard her
            starship, custodian of the stolen plans
            that can save her people and restore
            freedom to the galaxy....
